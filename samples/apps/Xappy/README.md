# Check Out the Prototype

Launch the [Figma Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/CmoqgJhUGPkKWTaPbzYrJCNv/Demo-Xamarin-App?node-id=866%3A2037&viewport=524%2C577%2C0.103049&scaling=scale-down).

* If you are able, please add any comments using the Figma comment feature.
* If you are unable (and I suspect this will be the case), please [open an Issue here](https://github.com/davidortinau/Xappy/issues/new/choose).

Note that this is a clickable prototype. Tap around. This is NOT the design. :)

# Let's Build an App!

We are working on a new gallery app for all of us to enjoy. The app should:

* Be A Collaboration - join us as we iterate through the design, user experience, and implementation.
* Be Gorgeous - Xamarin and Xamarin.Forms are being used every day to create top notch apps. Let's show that!
* Be Modern - Xamarin.Forms is shipping new features to make it easier than ever to deliver current user experience.
* Be Useful - Rather than just a static gallery, the app should be useful as a tool for your to keep up to date with the steady stream of happenings in our open source community.
* Be Ready - At Build 2019!
