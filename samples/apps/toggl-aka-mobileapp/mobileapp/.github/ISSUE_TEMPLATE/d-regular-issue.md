## 🎯 What needs to be done?
<!-- REQUIRED. In just a sentence or two, without going in too much details, specify the main goal of the issue. The goal of this section is to define WHAT needs to be done, not HOW or WHY. -->

## 📝 Detailed explanation
<!-- OPTIONAL. If the short description above is not sufficient for the developer to complete the task (because of ambiguity or incompleteness), specify more details here. If there are business logic explanations or behaviors that need to be specified, this is the place to do it. THIS is the place for the WHY of the issue. -->

## 🎨 Graphical resources
<!-- OPTIONAL. If the design is needed and available for the issue, specify it here. Link to Zeplin or other resources, such as Material guidelines, etc. Anything that can help with understanding of how the end result should graphically look, put it here. -->

## 🛠 Technical remarks
<!-- OPTIONAL. Is there anything that must be technically defined or understood before attempting to solve the issue? Is there anything that the code must adhere to? This is the HOW. -->

## 🔗 Dependencies
<!-- OPTIONAL. Specify whether this issue requires anything else to be executed or solved first. Or if it's outcome depends on the outcome of anything else. This does not necessarily have to be a dependency on another issue, but any other kind of thing, artefact or event. -->

## 🏆 Outcome
<!-- REQUIRED, unless this would be a complete copy of the description, which may happen for the smallest of issues. Describe what is the final goal of the issue. Ask yourself this: what needs to be satisfied to consider the issue completed? What kind of functional test should a reviewer do to be able to approve a PR for this issue. -->

## 👕 Estimated complexity
<!-- OPTIONAL. For the issue complexity estimates, use the GitHub labels. But if there's anything else you need to add to describe the complexity, this is the place for it. -->

## 🖼 Express your sentiment towards the issue
<!-- OPTIONAL. This is optional and should be used to lighten up somebody's day. A GIF, a meme, a slogan, a poem or anything else that serves this purpose. Don't spend too much time browsing. -->
