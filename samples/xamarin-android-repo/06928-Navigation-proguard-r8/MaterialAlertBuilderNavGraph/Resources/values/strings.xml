		Google Play continues to add and enhance features to Subscription Purchases. They have added features such as Account Hold, Subscription Pause, Subscription Restore and the flexability to be able to Upgrade 
		or Downgrade your subscription at any time.
		\n\nWe provide the subscription state information for each subscription.
		Once you have made an initial subscription purchase, a subsription record will appear here below the heading Subscriptions.
		\n\nWhen you tap on a subscription record a new window will open, showing the current subscription status information directly from Google Play\'s servers.
		It includes details such as your Google Order Number, the Payment and Acknowledgement States of your subscription, Starting Date, Expiration Date, Auto-Renew Date and whether the Subscription has been cancelled 
		either by the system or by the subscriber.
		\n\nGoogle servers store Subscription date information in UTC format, we convert those dates to your local datetime format.
		\n\nFor a full discussion re the latest Google Play Subscription features and an example screenshot please refer to our User Guide.
		\n\nAdding a new para just for a Pixel 6 as the present length of this message is not long enough to make the content scroll without a configuration change.
		\n\nThat was enough, but one more can\'t hurt.
